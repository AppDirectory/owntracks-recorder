This is demo data. After installing the recorder with
`make install', create a directory within your storage
called `rec', within that one named `demo' and again
therein `iphone`, and then copy `demo-iphone.rec' into 
that so the result will be

  <storagedirectory>/rec/demo/iphone/demo-iphone.rec

You can then use this data for demonstration purposes,
taking into account that it's dated 2015-08-24.
